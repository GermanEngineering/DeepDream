# DeepDream
In this video I'm going to show you how you can create a deep dream video using your own images.

Prerequisites:
	Python 3.6.6
	Git

1) Clone GermanEngineering/DeepDream Git repository.
	Open command prompt
		WINDOWS cmd ENTER
	Create new directory for Git projects.
		mkdir GitProjects
	Navigate to created folder.
		cd GitProjects
	Clone repository.
		git clone https://github.com/GermanEngineering/DeepDream.git

2) Install dependencies
	Navigate to folder containing the requirement files.
		cd DeepDream/DeepDream
	List all files.
		dir
	If you have a GPU (or can afford to buy one) you should execute:
	(It's WAY FASTER(!) =)
		pip install -r requirementsGPU.txt
	If you need to run on CPU execute:
		pip install -r requirements.txt
	You can check all installed modules by executing:
		pip list
